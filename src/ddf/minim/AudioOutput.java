/**
 * An AudioOutput is a connection to the output of a computer's sound card. 
 * Typically the computer speakers are connected to this. 
 * You can use an AudioOutput to do real-time sound synthesis by patching 
 * UGens to an output object. You can get an AudioOutput object from Minim 
 * using one of five methods:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * AudioOutput getLineOut()
 * 
 * // specifiy either Minim.MONO or Minim.STEREO for type
 * AudioOutput getLineOut(int type)
 * 
 * // bufferSize is the size of the left, right,
 * // and mix buffers of the output you get back
 * AudioOutput getLineOut(int type, int bufferSize)
 * 
 * // sampleRate is a request for an output of a certain sample rate
 * AudioOutput getLineOut(int type, int bufferSize, float sampleRate)
 * 
 * // bitDepth is a request for an output with a certain bit depth
 * AudioInput getLineOut(int type, int bufferSize, float sampleRate, int bitDepth)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the event that an output doesn't exist with the requested parameters, 
 * Minim will spit out an error and return null. 
 * In general, you will want to use one of the first two methods listed above.
 * <p>
 * In addition to directly patching UGens to the output, you can also schedule 
 * "notes" to be played by the output at some time in the future. This can 
 * be very powerful when writing algorithmic music and sound. See the playNote
 * method for more information.

	 * playNote is a method of scheduling a "note" to be played at 
	 * some time in the future (or immediately), where a "note" is 
	 * an instance of a class that implements the Instrument interface.
	 * The Instrument interface requires you to implement a noteOn method 
	 * that accepts a float duration value and is called when that 
	 * Instrument should begin making sound, and a noteOff method 
	 * that is called when that Instrument should stop making sound.
	 * <p>
	 * Versions of playNote that do not have an Instrument argument
	 * will create an instance of a default Instrument that plays a
	 * sine tone based on the parameters passed in.
	 * <p>
	 * To facilitate writing algorithmic music, the start time and 
	 * duration of a note is expressed in <em>beats</em> and not in seconds. 
	 * By default, the tempo of an AudioOutput will be 60 BPM (beats per minute), 
	 * which means that beats are equivalent to seconds. If you want to think 
	 * in seconds when writing your note playing code, then simply don't change 
	 * the tempo of the output.
	 * <p>
	 * Another thing to keep in mind is that the AudioOutput processes its 
	 * note queue in its own Thread, so if you are going to queue up a lot of 
	 * notes at once you will want to use the pauseNotes method before queuing
	 * them. If you don't, the timing will be slightly off because the "now" that
	 * the start time of each note is an offset from will change from note to note.
	 * Once all of your notes have been added, you call resumeNotes to allow 
	 * the AudioOutput to process notes again.
