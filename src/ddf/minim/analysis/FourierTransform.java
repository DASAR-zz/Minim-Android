/**
 * A Fourier Transform is an algorithm that transforms a signal in the time
 * domain, such as a sample buffer, into a signal in the frequency domain, often
 * called the spectrum. The spectrum does not represent individual frequencies,
 * but actually represents frequency bands centered on particular frequencies.
 * The center frequency of each band is usually expressed as a fraction of the
 * sampling rate of the time domain signal and is equal to the index of the
 * frequency band divided by the total number of bands. The total number of
 * frequency bands is usually equal to the length of the time domain signal, but
 * access is only provided to frequency bands with indices less than half the
 * length, because they correspond to frequencies below the <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>.
 * In other words, given a signal of length <code>N</code>, there will be
 * <code>N/2</code> frequency bands in the spectrum.
 * <p>
 * As an example, if you construct a FourierTransform with a
 * <code>timeSize</code> of 1024 and and a <code>sampleRate</code> of 44100 Hz,
 * then the spectrum will contain values for frequencies below 22010 Hz, which
 * is the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate). If you ask for the value of
 * band number 5, this will correspond to a frequency band centered on
 * <code>5/1024 * 44100 = 0.0048828125 * 44100 = 215 Hz</code>. The width of
 * that frequency band is equal to <code>2/1024</code>, expressed as a fraction
 * of the total bandwidth of the spectrum. The total bandwith of the spectrum is
 * equal to the Nyquist frequency, which in this case is 22050, so the bandwidth
 * is equal to about 50 Hz. It is not necessary for you to remember all of these
 * relationships, though it is good to be aware of them. The function
 * <code>getFreq()</code> allows you to query the spectrum with a frequency in
 * Hz and the function <code>getBandWidth()</code> will return the bandwidth in
 * Hz of each frequency band in the spectrum.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage</b>
 * <p>
 * A typical usage of a FourierTransform is to analyze a signal so that the
 * frequency spectrum may be represented in some way, typically with vertical
 * lines. You could do this in Processing with the following code, where
 * <code>audio</code> is an AudioSource and <code>fft</code> is an FFT (one of
 * the derived classes of FourierTransform).
 * 
 * <pre>
 * fft.forward(audio.left);
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; fft.specSize(); i++) {
 * 	// draw the line for frequency band i, scaling it by 4 so we can see it a
 * 	// bit better
 * 	line(i, height, i, height - fft.getBand(i) * 4);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <b>Windowing</b>
 * <p>
 * Windowing is the process of shaping the audio samples before transforming
 * them to the frequency domain. The Fourier Transform assumes the sample buffer
 * is is a repetitive signal, if a sample buffer is not truly periodic within
 * the measured interval sharp discontinuities may arise that can introduce
 * spectral leakage. Spectral leakage is the speading of signal energy across
 * multiple FFT bins. This "spreading" can drown out narrow band signals and
 * hinder detection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">windowing
 * function</a> attempts to reduce spectral leakage by attenuating the measured
 * sample buffer at its end points to eliminate discontinuities. If you call the
 * <code>window()</code> function with an appropriate WindowFunction, such as
 * <code>HammingWindow()</code>, the sample buffers passed to the object for
 * analysis will be shaped by the current window before being transformed. The
 * result of using a window is to reduce the leakage in the spectrum somewhat.
 * <p>
 * <b>Averages</b>
 * <p>
 * FourierTransform also has functions that allow you to request the creation of
 * an average spectrum. An average spectrum is simply a spectrum with fewer
 * bands than the full spectrum where each average band is the average of the
 * amplitudes of some number of contiguous frequency bands in the full spectrum.
 * <p>
 * <code>linAverages()</code> allows you to specify the number of averages that
 * you want and will group frequency bands into groups of equal number. So if
 * you have a spectrum with 512 frequency bands and you ask for 64 averages,
 * each average will span 8 bands of the full spectrum.
 * <p>
 * <code>logAverages()</code> will group frequency bands by octave and allows
 * you to specify the size of the smallest octave to use (in Hz) and also how
 * many bands to split each octave into. So you might ask for the smallest
 * octave to be 60 Hz and to split each octave into two bands. The result is
 * that the bandwidth of each average is different. One frequency is an octave
 * above another when it's frequency is twice that of the lower frequency. So,
 * 120 Hz is an octave above 60 Hz, 240 Hz is an octave above 120 Hz, and so on.
 * When octaves are split, they are split based on Hz, so if you split the
 * octave 60-120 Hz in half, you will get 60-90Hz and 90-120Hz. You can see how
 * these bandwidths increase as your octave sizes grow. For instance, the last
 * octave will always span <code>sampleRate/4 - sampleRate/2</code>, which in
 * the case of audio sampled at 44100 Hz is 11025-22010 Hz. These
 * logarithmically spaced averages are usually much more useful than the full
 * spectrum or the linearly spaced averages because they map more directly to
 * how humans perceive sound.
 * <p>
 * <code>calcAvg()</code> allows you to specify the frequency band you want an
 * average calculated for. You might ask for 60-500Hz and this function will
 * group together the bands from the full spectrum that fall into that range and
 * average their amplitudes for you.
 * <p>
 * If you don't want any averages calculated, then you can call
 * <code>noAverages()</code>. This will not impact your ability to use
 * <code>calcAvg()</code>, it will merely prevent the object from calculating an
 * average array every time you use <code>forward()</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Inverse Transform</b>
 * <p>
 * FourierTransform also supports taking the inverse transform of a spectrum.
 * This means that a frequency spectrum will be transformed into a time domain
 * signal and placed in a provided sample buffer. The length of the time domain
 * signal will be <code>timeSize()</code> long. The <code>set</code> and
 * <code>scale</code> functions allow you the ability to shape the spectrum
 * already stored in the object before taking the inverse transform. You might
 * use these to filter frequencies in a spectrum or modify it in some other way.
