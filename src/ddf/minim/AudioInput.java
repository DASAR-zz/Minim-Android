/**
 * An AudioInput is a connection to the current record source of the computer. 
 * How the record source for a computer is set will depend on the soundcard and OS, 
 * but typically a user can open a control panel and set the source from there. 
 * Unfortunately, there is no way to set the record source from Java. 
 * This is particularly problematic on the Mac because the input will always wind 
 * up being connected to the Mic-In, even if the user has set the input differently 
 * using their audio control panel. 
 * <p>
 * You can obtain an AudioInput from Minim by using one of the getLineIn methods:
 * <pre>
 * // get the default STEREO input
 * AudioInput getLineIn()
 * 
 * // specifiy either Minim.MONO or Minim.STEREO for type
 * AudioInput getLineIn(int type)
 * 
 * // bufferSize is the size of the left, right,
 * // and mix buffers of the input you get back
 * AudioInput getLineIn(int type, int bufferSize)
 * 
 * // sampleRate is a request for an input of a certain sample rate
 * AudioInput getLineIn(int type, int bufferSize, float sampleRate)
 * 
 * // bitDepth is a request for an input with a certain bit depth
 * AudioInput getLineIn(int type, int bufferSize, float sampleRate, int bitDepth)
 * </pre>
 * In the event that an input doesn't exist with the requested parameters, 
 * Minim will spit out an error and return null. In general, 
 * you will want to use the first two methods listed above.
