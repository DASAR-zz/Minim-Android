/**
 * <code>MinimServiceProvider</code> is the interface that an audio
 * implementation must provide to <code>Minim</code>, to guarantee that it can
 * provide all of the functionality that Minim promises. All of the interfaces
 * in this package define functionality in the most minimal way possible, to
 * make it easy for people write their own implementations, since much of what
 * Minim provides can be done so without regard for the details of audio intput
 * and output. If you write your own implementation of this interface, or if you
 * are using one that someone else has written, all you must do is pass an
 * instantiation of it to the Minim constructor. That Minim object will then
 * delegate most of the work to the implementation.
