/**
 * The Bypass UGen allows you to wrap another UGen and then insert that UGen into your
 * signal chain using Bypass in its place. You can then dynamically route the 
 * audio through the wrapped UGen or simply allow incoming audio to pass through unaffected. 
 * Using a Bypass UGen allows you to avoid concurrency issues caused by patching and unpatching 
 * during runtime from a Thread other than the audio one.
 * <p>
 * Your usage of Bypass might look something like this:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * Bypass&lt;GranulateSteady&gt; granulate = new Bypass( new GranulateSteady() );<br/>
 * filePlayer.patch( granulate ).patch( mainOut );
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * If you needed to patch something else to one of the inputs of the GranulateSteady,
 * you'd use the <code>ugen</code> method of Bypass to retrieve the wrapped UGen
 * and operate on it:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * grainLenLine.patch( granulate.ugen().grainLen );
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * Now, calling the <code>activate</code> method will <em>bypass</em> the granulate effect 
 * so that the Bypass object outputs the audio that is coming into it. Calling the 
 * <code>deactivate</code> method will route the audio through the wrapped effect. The 
 * <code>isActive</code> method indicates whether or not the wrapped effect is currently 
 * being bypassed.
