/**
 * <code>AudioMetaData</code> provides information commonly found in ID3 tags.

 * similar information. So rather than refer to this information
 * as ID3Tags or similar, we simply call it metadata. This base 
 * class returns the empty string or -1 from all methods and
 * derived classes are expected to simply override the methods
 * that they have information for. This is a little less brittle
 * than using an interface because later on new properties can 
 * be added without breaking existing code.
