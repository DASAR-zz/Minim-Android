 * out to all of its listeners, giving each their own copy of the audio. In
 * other words, changes that the listeners make to the float arrays they receive
 * from a <code>SignalSplitter</code> will not be reflected in the arrays you
 * pass to <code>samples</code>. <code>SignalSplitter</code> is fully
 * <code>synchronized</code> so that listeners cannot be added and removed while
 * it is in the midst transmitting.
