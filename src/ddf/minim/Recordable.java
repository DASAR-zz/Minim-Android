 *            A <code>Recordable</code> object is one that can provide a program
 *            with floating point samples of the audio passing through it. It
 *            does this using <code>AudioListener</code>s. You add listeners to
 *            the <code>Recordable</code> and then the <code>Recordable</code>
 *            will call the appropriate <code>samples</code> method of all its
 *            listeners when it has a new buffer of samples. It is also possible
 *            to query a <code>Recordable</code> object for its buffer size,
 *            type (mono or stereo), and audio format.
